// There are paint n boards of length {l1, l2â€¦ln} and there are k painters available. Each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit of the board.
// The problem is to find the minimum time to get this job done under the constraints that any painter will only paint continuous sections of boards.
// Example 1 :
// Input : k = 10, Board[] = [1, 8, 11, 3]
// Output : 11

// Code below:
class PaintersPartion{
public:
    bool isPossible(vector<int> &boards, int k, int mid){
    int painterCount=1;
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=0;i<boards.size();i++){
        if(sum+boards[i]<=mid){
            sum += boards[i];
        }
        else{
            painterCount++;
            if(painterCount>k || boards[i]>mid){

            sum = boards[i];

        int e = sum;
